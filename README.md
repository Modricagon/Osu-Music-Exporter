# Osu-Music-Exporter
Music exporter for Osu!


Osu! Music Exporter is a program I made for ripping all the .mp3 files from Osu! and outputting them with metadata for Song Title, Artist, Album, Album Artwork etc into a folder.

The output takes a long time depending on your computer speed and the amount of maps you have. My library of 5000 beatmaps takes around 20 minutes to export.

Now you can jam out to your anime tunes anytime anywhere!
